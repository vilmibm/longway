# longway

being a little joke program based on a recurring utterance in [the Action Button review of Pac-Man by Tim Rogers](https://youtu.be/GPzVlTgZoCg?t=190).

```bash
MOBYKEY=moby_123abc go run main.go
wow. games sure have come a long way since Bust-A-Move 4 for Windows!
```

that's it. there are no flags. the output is slightly randomized.

thanks, [moby games](https://mobygames.com), for the slick API <3
